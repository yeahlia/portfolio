            I am a sound designer and interactive media developer working at the intersection of sound, storytelling, and technology. Currently completing my Bachelor of Design (Digital Media) at RMIT in Naarm/Melbourne, I combine formal training with hands-on experience across sound, coding, and digital storytelling projects both inside and outside the university.

        <p>
          Sound and music have always been central to my life, from playing in bands, going to shows, and eventually creating my own work. That path naturally led me to sound design for visual media, where I discovered how audio can shape atmosphere, guide emotion, and transform a project's impact. I'm fascinated by the moments where sound, which is often subtle or overlooked, becomes the element that makes a story resonate. But that curiosity also led me into building interactive tools, generative systems, and narrative-driven digital experiences. I love exploring how sound, code, and interaction can work together to shape atmosphere and guide an emotional/narrative arc.
        </p>
        <p>
          My process starts with understanding the vision: the inspirations, tone, and emotional goals behind the project. I want to know what you want the audience to feel, then build on that with my own creative perspective. I gather references, collect sounds, sketch ideas early, and prototype quickly. From there, I develop multiple drafts and refine them through iteration and clear feedback for a streamlined, intentional workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether I'm designing audio for animation or games, building interactive storytelling pieces, or developing tools, my focus is always on how the experience unfolds moment by moment. I'm drawn to projects that let me shape emotion, build worlds, and explore how people connect with digital media.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love collaborating with other creatives (animators, designers, musicians, developers, etc. ) and seeing a project grow through shared ideas and diverse skill sets. If you have a vision, whether it's emotional, technical, or somewhere in between, I'd love to help bring it to life.
